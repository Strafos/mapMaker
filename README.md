# mapMaker
Scraps google maps to create high detail maps over a large area

mapMaker.py creates the map

imageCropper will crop the map to specified aspect ratio

imageMaker.py and imageStitcher.py run subsequently is equivalent to running mapMaker. Using these two programs instead of mapMaker
is recommended for large maps (IMG_COUNTER > 15)
